== Objective

The HL7® FHIR technology (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is used in the OpenNCP Reference Implementation to implement the workflows and the clinical document definition used in parallel of the usual IHE Technical Framework https://www.ihe.net/resources/technical_frameworks/#IT.

The FHIR implementation of OpenNCP is reusing as much as possible existing MyHealth@EU components and adds a new use case https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/x/9AWiTQ using FHIR the HL7® FHIR technology.

Main feature of MyHealth@EU should be present into the FHIR implementation:

Security and authorization.
Patient demographics: search and retrieve.
Laboratory Result report: search and retrieve.
Secured Audit node.

Conceptually, the FHIR implemention can be divided in 3 parts:
