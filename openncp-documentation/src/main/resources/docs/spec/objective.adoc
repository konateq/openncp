== Objective

Main objective of the MyHealth@EU Laboratory Result Report prototype is to demonstrate that FHIR standard https://www.hl7.org/fhir/ can be added to the OpenNCP Reference Implementation as an extension and being used in parallel of the usual IHE Technical Framework https://www.ihe.net/resources/technical_frameworks/#IT.

The scope of this prototype is to reuse as much as possible existing MyHealth@EU components and to add this new Use Case https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/x/9AWiTQ using FHIR.

Main feature of MyHealth@EU should be present into the FHIR implementation:

Security and authorization.
Patient demographics: search and retrieve.
Laboratory Result report: search and retrieve.
Secured Audit node.


Conceptually, the FHIR PoC can be divided in 3 parts:
