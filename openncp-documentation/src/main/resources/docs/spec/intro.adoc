This documents details an ongoing proof of concept that aims to implement FHIR in the current MyHealth@EU NCP application. +
These pages are documenting the currently implemented components, and indicating the direction that will be taken and listing possible options that are under investigation. It cannot be seen as a final documentation, but as a draft that will be kept in sync with the progress of the technical implementation. Feel free to add suggestions, feedback and/or comments.
