=== Visualisation

For the visualisation of the FHIR bundle, the starting point is the JSON file representing the bundle.

==== Liquid

https://shopify.github.io/liquid/[Liquid] is an open-source template language created by https://www.shopify.com/[Shopify] and written in Ruby.

It is included in the MyHealth@EU FHIR IG to display the bundle example: https://fhir.ehdsi.eu/laboratory/Bundle-BundleLabResultReportPOC.html

==== Javascript

JSON can very easily be translated into JavaScript. JavaScript can be used to make HTML in your web pages.

JSON functions are a more useable method and can be easily incorporated into a web application. The key function that enables us to convert JSON to HTML at runtime is `JSON.parse()`. The `JSON.parse()` method takes textual JSON data and converts it to a JavaScript object. You can then easily use this object to display data in HTML.
